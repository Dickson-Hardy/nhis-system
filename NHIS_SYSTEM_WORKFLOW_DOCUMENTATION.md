# NHIS System Workflow Documentation

## Executive Summary

The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) system operates on a **TPA-Autonomous Model** where Third Party Administrators (TPAs) handle all claim processing independently, while NHIS provides oversight and monitoring functions. This document outlines the complete workflow from healthcare facilities through TPAs to NHIS, covering all possible scenarios and decision points.

---

## System Architecture Overview

### **Primary Stakeholders**
1. **Healthcare Facilities** - Generate and submit claims
2. **Third Party Administrators (TPAs)** - Process, verify, and pay claims autonomously
3. **National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)** - Oversees operations and maintains data integrity

### **Core Principle**
TPAs operate with **full autonomy** in claim processing and payment decisions. NHIS serves as an **oversight body** that monitors, audits, and ensures compliance without blocking operational workflows.

## Phase 1: Healthcare Facility Operations

### **1.1 Patient Treatment and Documentation**

**Trigger:** Patient receives healthcare services at an accredited facility

**Process:**
- Healthcare facility provides medical treatment to NHIS beneficiaries
- Medical staff document all services, procedures, medications, and costs
- Claims officer compiles treatment information into standardized claim format
- Each claim receives a unique identifier for tracking purposes

**Data Captured:**
- Patient demographics and NHIS beneficiary details
- Medical diagnoses (primary and secondary)
- Treatment procedures and interventions
- Medication prescriptions and quantities
- Cost breakdown (investigation, procedure, medication, other services)
- Duration of treatment (admission to discharge dates)
- Healthcare provider signatures and certifications

### **1.2 Claim Preparation and Validation**

**Process:**
- Facility claims officer reviews all documentation for completeness
- Medical records are cross-referenced with billing information
- Claims are validated against NHIS treatment protocols and fee schedules
- Any discrepancies or missing information is resolved before submission

**Quality Checks:**
- Verify patient eligibility and active NHIS status
- Ensure all required medical documentation is complete
- Confirm cost calculations are accurate and within approved limits
- Check that treatment aligns with medical diagnosis
- Validate that all signatures and approvals are in place

### **1.3 Claim Submission to TPA**

**Submission Methods:**
- **Excel Upload:** Bulk submission via standardized Excel templates
- **Manual Entry:** Individual claim entry through web portal
- **API Integration:** Automated submission from facility management systems (future enhancement)

**Batch Creation:**
- Claims are grouped into batches (typically weekly or bi-weekly)

The success of this model depends on:
- Clear communication and coordination between all stakeholders
- Robust monitoring and quality assurance processes
- Continuous improvement and adaptation to changing needs
- Strong governance frameworks that balance autonomy with accountability

This documentation serves as the comprehensive guide for understanding how the NHIS system operates, covering all normal processes as well as exception scenarios that may arise.
